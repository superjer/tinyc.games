# tinyc.games
Tiny C games you can compile and run RIGHT NOW.

Tools and libraries are available for making cross-platform C games, but simple examples can be hard to find.

This project is an example of how you can get started making a game in C that will work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## How do I do it?

### Windows
1. TCC, SDL2, and GLEW are already included!
2. Open a game folder and run run-windows.bat
3. For OpenGL games you will need the Windows SDK from Microsoft

### Mac
1. Install clang by typing "clang" in Terminal and clicking the Install button.
2. Open a game folder and run run-mac.sh

### Linux
1. Install tcc, SDL2-dev, and GLEW-dev. Eg. for Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install tcc libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libglew-dev

2. Open a game folder and run run-linux.sh

## Next?

After you're done playing an exhilirating demo game, open the .c file in your favorite text editor. You're now looking at the actual code you just ran. So feel free to tinker and run it with your changes. Or use it as a starting point for your own game!
